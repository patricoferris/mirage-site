*Disclaimer: The work presented in this post and the repositories it references build on work by [@dra27](https://github.com/dra27), [@kcsrk](https://twitter.com/kc_srk), [@SaiVK](https://github.com/SaiVK) and [@nojb](https://twitter.com/nojebar). Wherever possible (e.g. commits) I've tried to be transparent and accredit the work to them* 

This post has the following structure: 

  - **RISC-V**: a breif discussion on why RISC-V is an important project and what makes it so cool. 
  - **OCaml Cross-Compiling**: how to setup an OCaml cross-compiler to make RV64G executables and where you can run them. 
  - **Opam Integration**: how to leverage the OCaml package manager and the [dune](https://dune.build/) build tool to make *real-world* OCaml programs.
